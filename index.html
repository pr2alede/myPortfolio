      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I'm a History graduate that went on the train as a secondary school ICT teacher. I started teaching in 2010, but since then there has been a lot of development in the curricilum with a lot of emphasis in teaching Computer Science and programming. 
        I had limited experience of this and as result I have had to develop my skills and knowledge over the years. I have enjoyed progressing my skills but looking to develop further through a number of courses on Codeacademy.com.</p>
